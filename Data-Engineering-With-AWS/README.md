## Projects

### Data Modelling

[Data modeling with Apache Cassandra](1_Data_Modelling/project/data_modelling_project.ipynb)

In this project,

- Apply concepts learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python.
- Model the data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.

### Cloud Data Warehouses

[Data warehousing with AWS Redshift](2_Cloud_Data_Warehouses/project/README.md)

In this project,

- Apply concepts on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift.
- To complete the project, need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

### Spark and Data Lakes

[STEDI Human Balance Analytics](3_Spark_and_Data_Lakes/project/README.md)

In this project,

- Use Spark and AWS Glue allow you to process data from multiple sources, categorize the data, and curate it to be queried in the future for multiple purposes.
- Build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.

### Automate Data Pipelines

[Data Pipelines with Airflow](4_Automate_Data_Pipelines/project/README.md)

In this project,

- Using Airflow to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills.
- Create custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.
